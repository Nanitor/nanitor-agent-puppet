# Dockerfile.dev
# ===========================
#
# Development container for Nanitor Puppet module
#
# This image is used to test and develop the Nanitor Agent Puppet module
# in a clean, reproducible Debian environment with Puppet 7 and required modules pre-installed.
#
# It uses Debian Bullseye, sets up locales correctly for UTF-8, and installs
# puppet-agent and puppetlabs-apt for testing module functionality locally.
